# Integration-Testing-Journey

Welcome to my journey of learning and mastering integration testing! This repository serves as a personal hub for code examples, notes, and resources related to integration testing in software development.

## About the Project

This repo chronicles my experiences, challenges, and successes in integration testing. Integration testing involves verifying that different modules or services work together as expected.
